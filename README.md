The Sudoku game created in C++ is a console-based application where players can solve a traditional 9x9 Sudoku puzzle. 
The game allows users to input numbers between 1 and 9 into the grid while ensuring that no duplicates appear in any row,
column, or 3x3 subgrid, adhering to the standard Sudoku rules. The game features a puzzle generator that creates a random solvable Sudoku puzzle at the start,
and players can make moves by specifying the row, column, and number they want to place. After each move, the grid is updated and displayed, and the program checks if the move 
is valid or if the puzzle is solved correctly. To run the game, users need to compile the provided C++ source code using a C++ compiler like g++, and then run the program through 
the terminal or command prompt. Once the puzzle is completed without errors, the game congratulates the player for successfully solving the puzzle. The game provides a simple yet
interactive way for users to engage with Sudoku while practicing their logic and problem-solving skills.
